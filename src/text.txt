install sensor

    
On the monitoring spots list you need to add a QR code icon next to each of them.

When you click the icon, you need to open modal.

Modal should be able to search for sensors by their serial number in a select dropdown. (/api/sensors?search=)

THe user selects a sensor. And clicks install. (it sends request to sensors/install and passes monitoring_spot_id and serial_number).
